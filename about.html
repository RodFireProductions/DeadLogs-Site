                            <i>The creating of DeadJournals honestly just came out of a whim.</i>
                            <br><br>
                            For awhile
                            I had been thinking of a good way to format and display blog like posts
                            for my <a href="https://deadinsideartist.art" target="_blank">personal website</a>.
                            My main site is currently run using Jekyll but even with Jekyll's
                            convience, it just didn't seem write for me to actually makes posts on it.
                            I think it's the idea of needing to make my site look professional and clean
                            that's making things seems uneasy to me.
                            <br><br>
                            The push to create DeadJournals was out of a need of mine to make my own kind
                            of templating code. Jekyll is nice, I won't deny that, but I'm truly not sure
                            if it's for me, definitely not if I wish to blog/devlog about my work.
                            One thing about it that really pushes me away is it wanting you to write your
                            posts in markdown. Of course, you don't have to but you'll end up mainly dealing
                            with markdown files anyways and it's a turn off for me.
                            <br><br>
                            One night my brain told me I should finally trying making my own blogging system
                            ended up jumping head first into it without really knowing what I was doing,
                            but I soon got the hang of it. In the middle of my development, the idea hit me
                            to not just make this a personal blog, but to make it into a tool that can be easily
                            reused when needed. I figured it'd be nice to make this tool public as well for
                            anyone who was in need of a less complicated and intimidating static site template
                            system.
                            <br><br>
                            Plus, this is great webdevelopment practice for me. I've already learned a lot
                            so far when it comes to dealing with HTML DOM in Javascript.

                            I mean you don't technically have to; you could use a wysiwyg editor that converts
                            to html or use a markdown to html converter if you can't or don't want to write the
                            html code yourself.
