                    Welcome to the DeadLogs' starting tutorial! Though the files themselves
                    are filled with comments, it still felt necessary
                    to give at least a little outside guidance.
                </p>

                <!-- Downloading -->
                <section>
                    <h3>Download a theme</h3>

                    <p>
                        First things first—you need to pick a premade theme and download it.
                        There are <a href="examples.html">examples</a> up to show you your
                        options. <mark>You can edit the theme to your liking later.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you've chosen a theme, you should download it from either
                        <a href="https://rodfireproductions.itch.io/deadlogs" target="_blank">Itch</a>
                        or <a href="https://github.com/RodFireProductions/DeadLogs/releases" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
                        After it's downloaded, you need to unzip it. There should be a folder
                        named after the theme you choose. This will be your site folder; feel
                        free to rename it to whatever you want.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <div class="right" id="configure">◉</div>
                <!-- Configuring -->
                <section>
                    <h3>Configure site variables</h3>

                    <p>
                        So, now that your site is downloaded, you need to set some variables.
                        Open <code>deadlogs.js</code> in a text editor or IDE. You should be
                        bombarded with comments once opened. They explain some of what we're
                        going to go over here. We'll be going through them in sections.
                    </p>

                    <h4>First Section: About the site</h4>

<pre><code>let siteName = 'My Site!';
let lang = 'en'; // The language of your site. Example, en = english, fr = français (french), etc.
let siteUrl = ''; // You can just put the url of your site here, whether that be a subdomain or custom.

// Put down your name and website/social media
let author = {
    name: 'Your Name',
    url: ''
};</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        I feel as if these variables are kinda self-explanatory.
                        The name of your site, your sites url, your name, and the
                        url to one of your socials or websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The variable I'd like to point out is the <code>lang</code>.
                        Whatever you define <code>lang</code> as gets automatically
                        inserted in your HTML files. It's <mark>very important for accessibility</mark>
                        reasons for you to put the proper tag in for the language your
                        site will be in. You can read more about it in the
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Second Section: Navigation</h4>

<pre><code>// This is where you define the pages that'll be in your navigation bar throughout the site.
let navi = [
    ['home','/index.html'],
    ['about','/about.html'],
    ['archive','/archive.html']
];</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        The <code>navi</code> variable lists all of the pages
                        that will be included in the header navigation. By default,
                        this variable includes a home page, about page, and archive page.
                        You can change the navigation how ever you want. Add pages, subtract pages,
                        etc. Just keep in mind how packed the header may become if you add too many.
                    </p>
<pre><code>// The link that holds the archive list.
let middleLink = ['archive', '/archive.html'];</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The <code>middleLink</code> is the link that's listed inbetween
                        the 'next' and 'previous' links:
                    </p>

                    <img class="centered bordered imged" src="assets/images/posts/postnav.webp" alt="The default post navigation.">

                    <p>
                        By default, it's set to the archive page, but it can be anything
                        you want. Or, you can leave it blank for nothing.
                    </p>


<pre><code>// Name of folder your posts are in.
let folder = 'post';</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        The <code>folder</code> is simply the name of the folder that
                        your post are going to be in. By default, the folder is named 'post';
                        you can see it in your files, but if you don't like that then you
                        can change it. Maybe you want it to be called 'files', 'pages', etc.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Third Section: The Footer</h4>

<pre><code>// This is the text that appears in the footer of your site. Feel free to customize it.
let footer = `
    Owned & Written by &#60;a href="${author.url}" target="_blank"&#62;${author.name}&#60;/a&#62;
`;</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is simply the code that get inserted into your footer. By default,
                        it inserts what you put as your name and social link in whilst
                        saying you own the site. You can change this how ever you'd like.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Fourth Section: The Archive</h4>

<pre><code>let postArchive = [
    //['Title', 'Date', 'Location']
];</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is where all your posts will be accounted for.
                        Every post you want to have shown up in the post navigation
                        and archive should be put here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're actually going to be covering how to set this up
                        in the <a href="#archpo">next section</a>.
                    </p>

                </section>
                <div class="right" id="first">◉</div>
                <!-- First Post -->
                <section>
                    <h3>Make your first post</h3>

                    <p>
                        First, you need to create a new file in your 'post' folder, or whatever
                        you may have renamed it, and save it as an HTML file. I'll be referring
                        to it as <code>example.html</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that same folder, there should be a file named <code>template.html</code>.
                        Copy the contents of that file and paste them it into <code>example.html</code>.
                    </p>

<pre><code id="archpo">let postArchive = [
    //['Title', 'Date', 'Location']
];</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        And now we're back at <code>postArchive</code>. Every time
                        you make a new post, you're going to want to add it to this list.
                        Let's add <code>example.html</code>:
                    </p>

<pre><code id="archpo">let postArchive = [
    //['Title', 'Date', 'Location']
    ['Example Post', 'May 11th, 2022', 'example.html']
];</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        As the comment says, you want to list posts' information in the
                        correct order. It doesn't matter what you name your post or how
                        you format the date. Heck, you don't even have to use that space for a date.
                        You can use it for a tag name if you wanted to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, let's add a second file to the archive list. I'll call it <code>example2.html</code>.
                    </p>

<pre><code id="archpo">let postArchive = [
    //['Title', 'Date', 'Location']
    ['Example Post', 'May 11th, 2022', 'example.html'],
    ['Example Post 2', '11 May 2022', 'example2.html']
];</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        When adding additional posts to the list, you need to add them to the
                        bottom of the list. Make sure to add a comma at the end of the post before it
                        or JavaScript will freak out over your imperfect syntax.
                    </p>

                </section>
                <div class="right" id="add">◉</div>
                <!-- Adding Content -->
                <section>
                    <h3>Add content</h3>

                    <p>
                        In each file, there's an area where it states to type your
                        content at. Make sure you keep all the main content of your
                        pages within the <code>&#60;main&#62;</code> tags.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is what these sections might look like:
                    </p>
<pre><code>&#60;main&#62;
    &#60;!------------------------------------------------&#62;
    &#60;!-- This is where you place your content! --&#62;

&#60;/main&#62;</code></pre>
<pre><code>&#60;main&#62;
    &#60;!------------------------------------------------&#62;
    &#60;!-- This is where you place your post content! --&#62;
    &#60;!--
        I recommend not deleting the `template.html` file,
        but instead to copy from it.
    --&#62;

&#60;/main&#62;</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        In the top level of your files, where your <code>index.html</code>
                        file is, you will have to type the header and title into while you
                        don't have to for your posts.
                    </p>

<pre><code>&#60;title&#62;Your page title&#60;/title&#62;</code></pre>
<pre><code>&#60;h1&#62;Your page title&#60;/h1&#62;</code></pre>
