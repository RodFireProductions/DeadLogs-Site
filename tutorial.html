                        are filled with comments explain what things are, it still felt necessary
                        to give at least a little outside guidance.

                        <h2>Download DeadJournals</h2>
                        <p>
                            First thing first is downloading the <code>deadjournals_(theme).zip</code> file.
                            This can be downloaded on the <a href="https://rodfireproductions.itch.io/deadjournals" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>
                            or right <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RodFireProductions/DeadJournals/releases">here</a>. The
                            current theme options: <span id="theme_options"></span>.
                            Note: If you plan on doing all of your own css,
                            it's recommended you start with an Absent theme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the zip is downloaded, you need to unzip it to a desired location.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">-❁-</div>
                    <section id="basicconfigs">
                        <h2>Set Up Basic Configurations</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once you've got everything unzipped, you need to begin setting
                            up your <code>script.js</code> file. As you can probably see,
                            that file is riddled with comments. Comments are everywhere.
                            Those comments will explain what each variable does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd suggest filling out the first 36 lines of that file to go ahead
                            and get some of the basic page generation features of DeadJournals
                            customized to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's what those lines look like without all of those comments.
                            I'll go through each of the sections I labelled here.
                        </p>
                        <pre><div class="code"><span class="green">// <a href="#sectiona">Section A</a></span>
let siteName = "My Site!";
let lang = "en";
let siteUrl = "";

<span class="green">// <a href="#sectionb">Section B</a></span>
let socials = [
    ['My Blog', siteUrl]
]

let author = {
    name: 'Your Name',
    title: 'A human on the internet',
    picture: null,
    extra: ['human'],
    line: null
}</div></pre>
                        <h4 id="sectiona">Section A</h4>
                        <p>
                            The first variable you get the configure is <code>siteName</code>
                            which is merely the name of your site, like this site is named
                            DeadJournals and Facebook is named Facebook.
                            <br><br>
                            Secondly, <code>lang</code>
                            is the language that your site will be in. By default, 'en' (English) is used as
                            the value. You can change this value though if you plan on writing
                            your site in a different language. Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">source</a>
                            with a reference list for other languages. This language tag helps
                            screen reader technology, search engines, and page formatting.
                            <br><br>
                            The last one here is <code>siteUrl</code>. This is the least
                            important of the three. This variable is not used anywhere in
                            the code but the <code>socials</code> array by default. It is
                            meant to be a way to quickly link the home page of your site
                            where you want in the code. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
                            You can leave this blank if you don't
                            wish to use it.<span>

                        </p>

                        <h4 id="sectionb">Section B</h4>
                        <p>
                            There's two parts of this section, <code>
                            socials</code> and <code>author</code>.
                            These both deal with the auto generator for the
                            about page. When both are completely filled out,
                            it'll generate something that looks a little like this
                            (results vary depending on theme) and it's code:
                        </p>

let socials = [

    ['DeadJournals', 'https://deadjournals.deadinsideartist.art'],

let author = {

    pronouns: 'ze/zir',
    extra: ['demiace', 'swirling'],

}

                            <b>Why is this tool named DeadJournals?</b><br>
                            I name everything 'dead' at first as a placeholder. I just didn't care
                            to figure out a better name for this one.

                            <b>Do you really have to know html to use DeadJournals?</b><br>
                            I mean you don't technically have to; you could use a wysiwyg (what you see is what you get)
                            editor that converts
                            to html or use a markdown to html converter if you can't or don't want to write the
                            html code yourself.<br>
                            Here are some options:
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://markdowntohtml.com/">Markdown editor</a> |
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://htmlg.com/html-editor/">Wysiwyg editor</a>.
