                        Welcome to the DeadJournals's quick tutorial! Though the files themselves
                        are filled with comments explain what things are, it still felt necessary
                        to give at least a little outside guidance.

                        <h2>Download DeadJournals</h2>
                        <p>
                            First thing first is downloading the <code>deadjournals_(theme).zip</code> file.
                            This can be downloaded on the <a href="https://rodfireproductions.itch.io/deadjournals" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>
                            or right <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RodFireProductions/DeadJournals/releases">here</a>. The
                            current theme options: <span id="theme_options"></span>.
                            Note: If you plan on doing all of your own css,
                            it's recommended you start with an Absent theme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two different templates as of right now, the blog
                            template and the comic template. The comic ones will have
                            <code>comic</code> in its file name, while the others will
                            be just the default blog ones.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            Once the zip is downloaded, you need to unzip it to a desired location.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">-❁-</div>
                    <section id="basicconfigs">
                        <h2>Set Up Basic Configurations</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once you've got everything unzipped, you need to begin setting
                            up your <code>script.js</code> file. As you can probably see,
                            that file is riddled with comments. Comments are everywhere.
                            Those comments will explain what each variable does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd suggest filling out the first 36 lines of that file to go ahead
                            and get some of the basic page generation features of DeadJournals
                            customized to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's what those lines look like without all of those comments.
                            I'll go through each of the sections I labelled here.
                        </p>
                        <pre><div class="code"><span class="green">// <a href="#sectiona">Section A</a></span>
let siteName = "My Site!";
let lang = "en";
let siteUrl = "";

<span class="green">// <a href="#sectionb">Section B</a></span>
let socials = [
    ['My Blog', siteUrl]
]

let author = {
    name: 'Your Name',
    title: 'A human on the internet',
    picture: null,
    extra: ['human'],
    line: null
}</div></pre>
                        <h3 id="sectiona">Section A</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first variable you get the configure is <code>siteName</code>
                            which is merely the name of your site, like this site is named
                            DeadJournals and Facebook is named Facebook.
                            <br><br>
                            Secondly, <code>lang</code>
                            is the language that your site will be in. By default, 'en' (English) is used as
                            the value. You can change this value though if you plan on writing
                            your site in a different language. Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">source</a>
                            with a reference list for other languages. This language tag helps
                            screen reader technology, search engines, and page formatting.
                            <br><br>
                            The last one here is <code>siteUrl</code>. This is the least
                            important of the three. This variable is not used anywhere in
                            the code but the <code>socials</code> array by default. It is
                            meant to be a way to quickly link the home page of your site
                            where you want in the code. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
                            You can leave this blank if you don't
                            wish to use it.<span>

                        </p>

                        <h3 id="sectionb">Section B</h3>
                        <p>
                            There's two parts of this section, <code>
                            socials</code> and <code>author</code>.
                            These both deal with the auto generator for the
                            about page. When both are completely filled out,
                            it'll generate something that looks a little like this
                            (results vary depending on theme) and it's code:
                        </p>

<pre class="code">
let socials = [
    ['My Blog', siteUrl], <span class="green">// In this case, siteUrl is set to this example site's home page</span>
    ['DeadJournals', 'https://deadjournals.deadinsideartist.art'],
    ['GitHub', 'https://github.com/RodFireProductions/DeadJournals/tree/main/examples/absent']
]

let author = {
    name: "White Void",
    title: 'The Purest Abyss',
    picture: "./assets/images/author.png",
    pronouns: 'ze/zir',
    extra: ['demiace', 'swirling'],
    line: '"<b>BE NOT AFRAID</b>" - Biblically Accurate Angels'
}
</pre>

                    </section>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">-❁-</div>

                    <section id="navigation">
                        <h2>Page Creation and Navigation</h2>
                        <p>
                            DeadJournals comes with two different archive and navigation
                            systems. The blog system is the one used for a basic blog, while
                            comic system is meant to be used for webcomics. Of course, you
                            could use the blog system for a webcomic, but I made the webcomic
                            one anyways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The simplist of the two is the blog system, while the comic one needs
                            a bit more effort.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="navblog">Blog</h3>

                        <p>
                            Make sure you keep all your posts are located in the
                            <code>post</code> folder; this is important. What they're named doesn't matter.
                        </p>

                        <h4 id="navblog1">Page Creation</h4>
                        <p>
                            First, you will need to make a copy of the <code>tutorial.html</code>
                            file or just copy and past the contents into a new file. Name
                            the file whatever, in this tutorial it'll be referred to as
                            <code>extra.html</code>, just make sure you put the <code>.html</code>
                            extension at the end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In your file, look for the section of code that looks like the following.
                            That's where you'll insert your page/post content. You don't need to edit
                            the file in any other place unless you know what you're doing.
                        </p>
<pre class="code">&#60;div class="postcontent"&#62;<span class="green">
    &#60;!------------------------------------------------&#62;
    &#60;!-- This is where you place your post content! --&#62;
    </span>

&#60;/div&#62;
</pre>
                        <h4 id="navblog2">Setting Up Navigation/Archive</h4>
                        <p>
                            Now we'll be working in the <code>script.js</code> file
                            again. Please locate this section of the code:
                        </p>
<pre class="code">let postArchive = [
    <span class="green">//['Title', 'Date', 'Location']</span>
]</pre>

                        <p>
                            There's a comment there that already shows you the basic format.
                            The title is simply the title of your post. The date is the day you
                            posted it. I'd just keeping all your date formats the same for all your
                            posts. And lastly the location is where your post file is located
                            relative to the <code>script.js</code> file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's what it would look like if I added the <code>extra.html</code>
                            file I created in the previous section:
                        </p>
<pre class="code">let postArchive = [
    <span class="green">//['Title', 'Date', 'Location']</span>
    ['First post!', '17 Nov 2021', 'post/extra.html']
]</pre>
                        <p>
                            Do know that you need to include a comma at the end of each
                            nested array before making a new one. You'll get a syntax
                            error if you don't. For example:
                        </p>
<pre class="code">    ['First post!', '17 Nov 2021', 'post/extra.html']<span style="color: red">,</span> <span class="green">// &#60;---</span>
    ['Second post!', '18 Nov 2021', 'post/extra2.html']
</pre>
                        <p>
                            <mark>
                                Everytime you want to add a new post, make sure you
                                add it at the <span style="text-decoration: underline">bottom</span>
                                of the array/list.
                            </mark>
                        </p>


                        <h3 id="navcomic">Comic</h3>
                        <h4 id="navcomic1">Page Creation</h4>

                        <p>
                            This template has two different folder options to keep
                            you comic/book chapters organized. You're able to keep your
                            pages in the <code>page</code> folder and in a folder inside
                            the <code>page</code> folder. By default, there is a folder
                            named <code>folder</code> (I know, very creative) in there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, you will need to make a copy of the <code>tutorial.html</code>
                            file or just copy and past the contents into a new file.
                            Depending on whether or not you want you file located in the
                            <code>post</code> folder of a child folder of it will change
                            which <code>template.html</code> file you copy. If you want to use a
                            child folder, copy the file in the <code>folder</code> folder, if not
                            then use the one in the <code>post</code> folder.
                            We'll go over how to properly name your file <a href="#comicnaming">here</a>.

                            In your file, look for the section of code that looks like the following.
                            That's where you'll insert your author comment. You don't need to edit
                            the file in any other place unless you know what you're doing.

                            We're first going to set up a chapter and go over how to
                            properly name files.
                            Locate the following snippet of code:
                        </p>
<pre class="code"><span class="green">//=// --- Chapter --- //=// [3]</span>

let chapterArchive = [
    {
        name: '', <span class="green">// Archive Chapter name</span>
        src: '', <span class="green">// HTML file prefix</span>
        location: 'page', <span class="green">// Folder location relative to this file's location</span>
        pages: null, <span class="green">// Insert the name of the array you made in the section before this</span>

        chapter: '', <span class="green">// Comic page chapter name</span>
        page: 'Page' <span class="green">// Page, episode, etc</span>
    }
]
</pre>
                    <p>
                        The array <code>chapterArchive</code> by default holds an empty
                        chapter dictionary. Within that dictionary is the a list of key values
                        that needs to be filled out for the archive and navigation system to properly
                        work. Let's go through them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The keys <code>name</code> and <code>chapter</code> are basically the
                        same thing. They're both suppose to hold that chapter's name. The
                        difference between the two is that <code>name</code> will be shown on
                        the archive page, while <code>chapter</code> will be shown in all of the
                        chapter pages' headers. It's recommended to keep <code>chapter</code> simple,
                        while <code>name</code> can have some jazzy decorations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>src</code> is very important when it comes to naming files. All
                        the files in that particular chapter NEED
                        their names to begin with whatever the value for <code>src</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The value for <code>location</code> is the relatvie folder location to
                        <code>script.js</code>'s location. By default, this value is "page". If
                        were wanting to use a folder inside the <code>page</code> for your files,
                        then the value would be "page/(folder name)".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The value for <code>page</code> is supposed to be whatever you wish
                        your pages to be referred as. For example, you can have it be "Page"
                        (Page 1), "Episode" (Episode 1), "Note" (Note 1), etc. You can be as
                        creative or uncreative as you want. Like <code>chapter</code>, this will
                        also appear in the page headers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, <code>pages</code>
                    </p>


<pre class="code"><span class="green">// Code snippet from the comic theme examples //</span>
let chapterArchive = [

                        <p>
                            Your site is just a simple static site, so it'll
                            be easy to find free hosting plans for it. Here
                            are some good platforms I'd suggest:
                        </p>

                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a></li>
                            <ul>

                            If you choose Neocities, I'd find it nice if you'd add the tag
                            <code>deadjournals</code> to your site.

                            <b>Why is this tool named DeadJournals?</b><br>
                            I name everything 'dead' at first as a placeholder. I just didn't care
                            to figure out a better name for this one.

                            <b>Do you really have to know html to use DeadJournals?</b><br>
                            I mean you don't technically have to; you could use a wysiwyg (what you see is what you get)
                            editor that converts
                            to html or use a markdown to html converter if you can't or don't want to write the
                            html code yourself.<br>
                            Here are some options:
