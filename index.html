                    <p>
                        DeadJournals is a tool for making static blogs using html,
                        css, and vanilla javascript. Minimum html markup and javascript
                        array and dictionary knowledge is needed to begin working with
                        DeadJournals.<br><br>
                        If you need a little help getting started, there's a <a href="./tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
                        waiting for you!
                    </p>

                    <h2>What's the purpose?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>Who needs a site creator with zero coding when you can get a
                        site creator with minimum coding?</i>
                        <br><br>
                        I suppose you could say DeadJournals is a waste of time with all the
                        other static site generators and website builders out there, and you
                        may be right. <i>But</i> isn't the idea of owning your site and being
                        able to transport it anywhere without having to pay to download it or
                        get the watermark removed pretty neat? Plus DeadJournals is merely a
                        simplistic shell; if one has the skill and knowledge, then they can add
                        any feature to their deadjournal they want. The sky is the limit!
                        And for those who don't know much or don't need much, they're able to
                        use DeadJournals as it comes with some possible tweaks.
