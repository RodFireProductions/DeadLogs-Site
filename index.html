                        DeadJournals is a tool for making static blogs and webcomic
                        sites using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. HTML and
                        Javascript (array and dictionary) knowledge is recommended
                        to begin working with DeadJournals.
                        <!--Minimum html markup and javascript

                        to see how I set it up since it was made using DeadJournals.

                    <h2>What's the purpose?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>Who needs a site creator with zero coding when you can get a
                        site creator with minimum coding?</i>
                        <br><br>
                        I suppose you could say DeadJournals is a waste of time with all the
                        other static site generators and website builders out there, and you
                        may be right. <i>But</i> isn't the idea of owning your site and being
                        able to transport it anywhere without having to pay to download it or
                        get the watermark removed pretty neat? <i>Plus</i>, DeadJournals is merely a
                        simplistic shell; if one has the skill and knowledge, then they can add
                        any feature to their deadjournal they want. The sky is the limit!
                        And for those who don't know much or don't need much, they're able to
                        use DeadJournals as it comes with some possible tweaks.
                        <i>Double plus</i>, you don't have to install different coding languages
                        or libraries to use DeadJournals, unlike static site generators like Jekyll,
                        Hugo, and Django. All you gotta do is download one of the template zips
                        and you're on your way.
                        <br><br>
                        I suppose <mark>the purpose of DeadJournals is</mark> to allow one to <mark>make
                        a simple, transportable, blog/site</mark> that <mark>doesn't need any extra technologies
                        </mark>downloaded or installed and has the ability to let one <mark>easily add on
                        their own extra features and styling</mark>. It is meant to allow hosting the
                        site to be easy and even free on some platforms.
